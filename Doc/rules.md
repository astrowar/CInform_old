exemplo :
  The ( nearest item ) rules is a rulebook producing an object
  ( nearest item ) when (thing  called T)  is in pocket: 
    rule succeeds with result T
  ( nearest item ) when (thing  called T)  is in location: 
    rule succeeds with result T    
  ( nearest item ) rule: 
     say "Nothing near to use "
     rule succeeds with result Nothing    

para acessar o item use a sintaxe :
 let (the near item)  be (the object) produced by ( nearest item ) rules
 
 ou seja :
  value = K produced by R rules
  
Para passar os argumentos :
    let (the near item)  be (the object) produced by ( nearest item ) rules for (argument) 
    follow  ( nearest item ) rules for (argument)    -> nao tem valor de retorno
    
Se tentar invocar sem argumento , ha um rumtime erro. invocar com retorno sem usar ele nao resulta em erro.

eh possivel fazer o resultado de uma regra ser o resultado de uma regra interna usando o  abide 

abide R rule by Y :
  follow  R rules for Y
  if rule succeeded :
     rule succeeds 
  if rule failed :     
     rule failed 


anonymously  abide R rule by Y :
  follow  R rules for Y
  if rule succeeded :
     rule succeeds with result ( K produced by R rules)   
  if rule failed :     
     rule failed with result ( K produced by R rules)
