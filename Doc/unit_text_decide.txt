thing is a kind of entity

chemical  is a kind of value
material is a kind of value

material are steel ,iron, plastic, glass and wood
thing has a material

chemical are water , acid and gas

material can be isolant or conductor
material is usually isolant

iron and steel are conductor

to decide if (thing called T ) is conductor:
    if (material of T) is conductor :
      decide on true

To decide if  (chemical called M) is volable: 
    if M is acid :
       decide on true        
    else:
       decide on false
	  
To decide what material is  best for (chemical called C ): 
   if C is water :
       decide on plastic
   if C is gas :
       decide on steel	   
   decide on glass 	  

To decide what material is  allowed for (chemical called C ): 
   if C is volable :
       decide on glass     
   decide on plastic 	  


 
	   
unit init:
   pin is a thing
   ball is a thing
   material of pin is iron
   material of ball is plastic
   
unit test:
  pass
